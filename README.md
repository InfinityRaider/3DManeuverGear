## Bug Reports [![bug]][bug-link]

Please report any and all bugs you might encounter while playing with this mod (this only applies to versions of Minecraft this mod is currently being developed for). Suggestions are also welcome.
However before reporting a bug please update to the latest version of the mod to see if it still persists.
If you want to post bug reports for older versions, make sure to tell me what version you are using and the version of Forge you are using.
If you report a bug and I request more feedback, the label 'Awaiting reply' will be added, if I have had no response for 5 days after adding that label, the issue will be closed.
